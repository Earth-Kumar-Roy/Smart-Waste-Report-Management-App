# 🗑️ Smart Waste Report Management App

**Mobilizing civic action through real-time sanitation tracking and accountability.**

The **Smart Waste Report Management App** is a full-spectrum digital tool designed to bridge the gap between citizens and sanitation workers. By leveraging GPS data and photo verification, the system eliminates location ambiguity and ensures that reported waste is actually cleared, fostering a cleaner and more transparent urban environment.

##  The Problem
* **Slow & Fragmented Reporting:** Traditional complaint systems are often offline or involve tedious manual processes.
* **Lack of Accountability:** Citizens rarely receive updates, and there is no proof that a task was completed effectively.
* **Location Confusion:** Text-based addresses in crowded or unplanned areas make it difficult for field workers to locate waste hotspots.

##  The Solution
* **📍 Auto GPS Capture:** Pinpoints the exact location of the waste without requiring manual address entry.
* **📸 Proof-of-Work Closure:** Tickets cannot be closed until the field worker uploads a "Cleanup Photo" for verification.
* **🎯 Zone-Based Assignment:** Intelligent routing ensures workers only see tasks relevant to their specific assigned region.
* **🔁 Status Updates:** Transparency for citizens from the moment of submission to the final resolution.
